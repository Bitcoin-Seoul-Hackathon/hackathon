## 2. Problem Definition

### Current Limitations in Gaming and Digital Worlds

The current landscape of gaming and digital worlds faces several limitations:

- **Centralized Control**: Most digital platforms are controlled by centralized entities, leading to issues such as censorship, data breaches, and lack of user autonomy.
- **Limited Interoperability**: Traditional games and platforms lack interoperability, restricting user experiences and cross-platform interactions.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Users often need to provide personal information, leading to privacy concerns and potential misuse of data.
- **Inadequate Incentives for Modding**: While modding is popular, current frameworks do not adequately incentivize creators, leading to legal risks and lack of financial rewards.

### Privacy and Security Issues

- **Data Breaches**: Centralized systems are prone to data breaches, risking user information.
- **Surveillance**: Users are often subject to surveillance and data tracking without their consent.
- **Ownership Rights**: Users do not have true ownership of their digital assets, which are often controlled by the platform providers.
